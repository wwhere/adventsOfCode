Advent of Code 2025.

More python!

# Day 1

Easy enough beginning, but I do feel I have forgotten a lot of what I learned about pythonic code last year!

# Day 2

I felt smart on part 1, which made having to go to brute force on part 2 quite sad.

# Day 3

Straightforward enough. Still, very anti-pythonic code!

# Day 4

Simple brute force is more than enough on this one

# Day 5

Easy enough thanks to Python dealing with big numbers "for free". Got stuck on an error dealing with one of the possible range intersections on part 2.

# Day 6

Another simple problem today.

# Day 7

The power of the power of 2 stops this being solvable by just the more direct approach.

# Day 8

I was very meticulous on this one, doing things bit by bit. Mostly because I was feeling very sleepy! Did work in the end.

# Day 9

Could not find an intuitive solution for Part 2, so in the end I looked for a python geometry library. Found one named `shapely` with exactly what was needed, a way to determine if a polygon is completely inside another polygon. Advantage of Python, I guess, but slightly bittersweet having to go with library helpers.
