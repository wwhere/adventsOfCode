Advent of Code 2025.

More python!

# Day 1

Easy enough beginning, but I do feel I have forgotten a lot of what I learned about pythonic code last year!

# Day 2

I felt smart on part 1, which made having to go to brute force on part 2 quite sad.

# Day 3

Straightforward enough. Still, very anti-pythonic code!

# Day 4

Simple brute force is more than enough on this one
